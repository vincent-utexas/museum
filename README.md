### About
Museum is a web application inspired by the save one, drop one game. Given a Spotify playlist, users select one track to keep, and the other is discarded.
Museum offers song recommendations by matching similar users based on the position of each track at the end of the game.

### Getting started
This app is currently in **development mode**. You may not be able to access the app (Spotify will block requests) unless you are allow-listed.
I am working on pushing the app to extended quota mode, where it will be freely available for use.

Visit the app [here](https://museum-beta.vercel.app) or visit https://museum-beta.vercel.app.

### Features in development
* Spotify albums
* Rank all mode
* Extended quota mode

Built using Angular, FastAPI, Spotify Web API.
